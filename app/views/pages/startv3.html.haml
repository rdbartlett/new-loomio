    %p.lead To make decisions together with people on Loomio, you'll need to set up a group:
    %form#form
      .form-group
        %label What is the name of your group?
        %input.form-control{placeholder: "E.g. Mean Millie's Motorcyle Gang for Mums"}

      .form-group
        %label How big is your group?
        %select.form-control#size
          %option{value: '0'} - Please select a group size -
          %option{value: '20'} up to 25 people
          %option{value: '40'} 25-50 people
          %option{value: '80'} 50-100 people
          %option{value: '160'} 100-200 people
          %option{value: '200'} more than 200 people

      .form-group

        %label What kind of group is it?
        %select.form-control#type
          %option{value: '0'} - Please select a group type -
          %option{value: 'formal'} Formal organisation - we have a budget
          %option{value: 'informal'} Informal community - we don't have the budget to pay for software

      .form-group
